# Benchmark-16-ML-Models-Using-the-Dry-Bean-Dataset
This project analyzed and compared the performance of 16 machine learning models on a supervised classification task using the Dry Bean dataset. This project pursued two objectives: (1) Measure how accurately each model classifies unseen bean samples, and (2) Determine each modelâ€™s runtime for its classification training and testing process.
